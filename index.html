    <div id="about">
        <h4 id="meet">Meet Our Family</h2>
        <p id="story">We are the Cutters! Karen Cutter and husband Tom Cutter met on a deep sea fishing tour in 2007 and our love for salmon brought us together!
            Tom has always had a love for baking and Karen dreamt of one day owning a small local business in her hometown, Seattle, Wa. Together they 
            have two wonderful children who have grown to love baking just as much as Tom. You may be wondering where the idea of salmon cookies came from.
            When our youngest, Jonny was 4 years old we found he had gotten into the bag of salmon flavored dog treat. It was easy to see just how much
            he enjoyed the delicious flavor so we decided to create a new human friendly recipe. After sharing with some friends, we were surprised to learn
            just how much they enjoyed the cookies as well so we took to the local farmers market. And here we are! With currently 5 stands around the world
            we have been able to share our unique, yet delectable salmon cookies!
